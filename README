This works in combination with the two modified files from the repository https://github.com/bkgarry/DigikeyboardBIOS

You should be able to copy this into the Arduino IDE to use with a digspart to program the functions below

Important - Modify String bios_password = "ENTER PASSWORD HERE"; by replacing ENTER PASSWORD HERE (keep the quote marks to set your desired password)

The script is designed that you boot into the BIOS and then insert your digispark to perform the following steps
- Go to the security screen
- Set the BIOS password witht he bios_password string declared at the top
- go to the Boot Options Screen
- Enable Network Boot
- Change UEFI Network boot to IPV4 only
- Change Network Boot to first boot device
- Save changes and restart
